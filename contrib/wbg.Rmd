# World Bank: COVID-19 pushing 71 to 100 million people into extreme poverty #

**COVID-19 is taking its toll on the world, causing deaths, illnesses and economic
despair. This contribution suggests that COVID-19 is pushing about 71 to 100 million
people into extreme poverty, and that South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa might be the
regions hardest hit.**

Nowcasting global poverty is not an easy task. It requires
assumptions about how to forecast growth, how such growth
will impact the poor and many other assumptions. Estimating
how much global poverty will increase because of COVID-19
is challenging and comes with much uncertainty.

This note is based on the latest household survey data for
166 countries in PovcalNet, an online tool for estimating
global poverty, with extrapolations using growth projections
from the June 2020 edition of the World Bank’s Global
Economic Prospects. Comparing these forecasts impacted by
COVID-19 with the forecasts from the previous edition of the
Global Economic Prospects published in January allows for an
assessment of the impact of the pandemic on global poverty.
Whereas other factors may have worsened or improved
countries’ growth outlooks between January and June, most
of the changes in the forecasts are due to the pandemic.

The forecasts reveal that COVID-19 is likely to cause the first
increase in global poverty since 1998, when the Asian financial
crisis hit. With the new forecasts, global poverty—the share of
the world’s population living on less than US $1.90 per day—is
projected to increase from 8.2 per cent in 2019 to 8.8 per cent
in 2020, or from 632 million people to 684 million people. The
projected decline over the same time period using the previous
Global Economic Prospects forecasts was from 8.0 per cent
to 7.7 per cent. The slight change in the base number from 8.2
to 8.0 per cent for 2019 happens because the revised growth
forecasts also changed for non-COVID reasons in some
countries. Taking this into account, the pandemic is driving
a change in the 2020 estimate of the global poverty rate of
0.9 percentage points. In absolute terms, it is estimated that
COVID-19 will push 71 million people into extreme poverty in
2020. In a downside scenario, which assumes that outbreaks
persist longer than expected forcing lockdown measures to be
maintained or reintroduced, 100 million people will be pushed
into poverty.
