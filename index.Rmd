# Introduction #


This is an experimental project to produce a "digital first" companion to the
*How COVID-19 Is Changing the World* series of reports from the [CCSA][ccsa].
The aspirations are to: produce an interactive, engaging product with each
member contributing its own source code and data; explore innovative
new ways of using data science tools for communication and collaboration;
demonstrate the potential of open data, open code, and reproducible research, and;
learn from our shared knowledge and experimentation.
