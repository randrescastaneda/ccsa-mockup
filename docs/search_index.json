The aspirations are to: produce an interactive, engaging product with each participant contributing its own source code and data; explore innovative new ways of using data science tools for communication and collaboration; demonstrate the potential of open data, open code, and reproducible research, and; learn from our shared knowledge and experimentation.

This contribution suggests that COVID-19 is pushing about 71 to 100 million people into extreme poverty, and that South Asia and Sub-Saharan Africa might be the regions hardest hit. Figure 1: The impact of COVID-19 on global poverty Nowcasting global poverty is not an easy task. It requires assumptions about how to forecast growth, how such growth will impact the poor and many other assumptions. Estimating how much global poverty will increase because of COVID-19 is challenging and comes with much uncertainty. This note is based on the latest household survey data for 166 countries in PovcalNet, an online tool for estimating global poverty, with extrapolations using growth projections from the June 2020 edition of the World Bank’s Global Economic Prospects. Comparing these forecasts impacted by COVID-19 with the forecasts from the previous edition of the Global Economic Prospects published in January allows for an assessment of the impact of the pandemic on global poverty. Whereas other factors may have worsened or improved countries’ growth outlooks between January and June, most of the changes in the forecasts are due to the pandemic. The forecasts reveal that COVID-19 is likely to cause the first increase in global poverty since 1998, when the Asian financial crisis hit. With the new forecasts, global poverty—the share of the world’s population living on less than US $1.90 per day—is projected to increase from 8.2 per cent in 2019 to 8.8 per cent in 2020, or from 632 million people to 684 million people. The projected decline over the same time period using the previous Global Economic Prospects forecasts was from 8.0 per cent to 7.7 per cent. The slight change in the base number from 8.2 to 8.0 per cent for 2019 happens because the revised growth forecasts also changed for non-COVID reasons in some countries. Taking this into account, the pandemic is driving a change in the 2020 estimate of the global poverty rate of 0.9 percentage points. In absolute terms, it is estimated that COVID-19 will push 71 million people into extreme poverty in 2020. In a downside scenario, which assumes that outbreaks persist longer than expected forcing lockdown measures to be maintained or reintroduced, 100 million people will be pushed into poverty.
